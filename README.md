# colorFill
A color-based territory game!

The goal is to conquer as much territory as possible.

Strategic selection of colors is the goal to winning.

The player with the most territory at the end is the winner.

By default there are 6 colors and you cannot, at any point in the game, choose the color of your opponent or yourself. So at any given point you have 4 colors to choose from to help conquer more territory.

You can have as many colors(>= 2) as you want, however gameplay will vary with different amounts of colors.
